## Virtual Environment
A virtual environment is an isolated workspace on your computer that is created specifically for your project. It allows you to install and manage libraries and dependencies that are only used by that particular project, rather than being shared system-wide or with other projects.

Normally, when you install Python libraries globally, they become available to all your projects. This can lead to issues, especially when different projects require different versions of the same library, potentially causing version conflicts. By creating a virtual environment, you ensure that each project has its own set of dependencies and package versions, fully separated from others. This isolation helps maintain a clean, conflict-free workspace for each project, making development and maintenance much easier.
### How to create a virtual env

>  python -m venv env
